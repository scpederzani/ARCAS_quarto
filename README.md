# ARCAS_quarto

This repository contains a tidied-up copy of the qmd files made during the Quarto demonstration of the ARCAS "Workshop on good statistical practice in archaeology" (09-11/02/2023). 

Render the qmd file to produce output files. The input folder contains data, inserted images and a bibliography file. The _quarto.yml file is a meta-data yaml file that can be used to set project-wide yaml options that should apply to all qmd documents.
